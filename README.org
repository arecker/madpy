#+TITLE: MadPy Demo

This is the accompanying source code for the demonstration I gave at
[[https://www.meetup.com/MadPython/][MadPython]].  The latest commit represents the final manifestation of
the web app, which includes a load balancer, autoscaling group, and an
immutable AMI provisioned with packer, but be sure to checkout the
previous commits to follow along with the intermediate, simpler
versions.
